      <h1 class="display-4 text-center">HISTORY OF<b class="text-info"> GWALIOR</h1></b>

      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">Gwalior history is rich and equally fascinating. Let’s take a look at some of the most significant aspects of Gwalior history today.</p>
      <p class="text-justify"><b>Folklore</b>
<br>
A local prince named Suraj Sen lost his way in the forest when he met a sage named Gwalipa. Suraj Sen was thirsty and Gwalipa took him to a pond where astonishingly, the pond’s water cured Suraj Sen of leprosy. When the prince wanted to offer the Sage something in return, the Sage requested the Prince to build a wall on the hill to protect the other sages from wild animals.  Suraj Sen accepted his request and also built a palace named Gwalior inside the fort.
<br>
<b>Early history</b>
<br>
An inscription of the Alchon Hun ruler Mihirakula describes Mihirakula’s father Toramana 493-515 as a great ruler. Mihirakula, on the other hand was described as “the lord of the earth” in 520 AD.</p>
<img src="http://gwaliortourist.pneducation.website/image/fort2.jpg" title="Gwalior Fort" style="width: 100%;height: 445px">

<p class="text-justify"><br><b>Muslim rule</b>
<br>Iltutmish took over Gwalior in 1231 and ruled till the 13th century. The Tomar Clan started ruling in 1375, when Raja Veer Singh was made the king of Gwalior. This period in the history of Gwalior is considered to be the most flourishing times of all. Rulers of Tomar Clan built the Jain sculptures at Gwalior Fort. Man Singh Tomar built the beautiful and extravagant Man Mandir Palace at Gwalior Fort.
<br>
<b>Maratha rule</b>
<br>
The Princely state of Gwalior was a part of the Maratha confederacy in the 1730s. Ranoji Shinde served as a solder, chieftain and Governor under Peshwa Baji Rao. He founded the Scindia dynasty and became the prince of Gwalior in 1761. From this time onwards, the capital of Gwalior Princely state was Ujjain until 1810. It is believed that the number Zero was first written at Chaturbhuj Temple at Gwalior Fort. Tansen had attended a famous singing school in Gwalior as well.
<br>
<b>Rebellion of 1857</b>
<br>
Gwalior was not a part of the 1857 rebellion as they did not want to help Rani Lakshmibai. When the rebels captured the fort, the British attacked Gwalior and won the battle. Tatya Tope and Rao Sahib managed to escape but Tatya Tope was captured and hanged in April 1859.
<br><br>
<b>British Raj and post Independence</b>
<br>

After the three Anglo-Maratha wars, Gwalior became the largest princely state of the Central India Agency. Known for its strategic location and fort strength, the Princely State of Gwalior received a 21 gun salute. The Scindias had controlled several Rajput states earlier and the state of Ajmer as well. The Scindia family ruled Gwalior from the UK until India’s independence. Maharaja Jivajirao Scindia signed the treaty of accession and Gwalior became a part of Madhya Bharat. On 31st October 1956, Madhya Bharat became a part of Madhya Pradesh.</p>
