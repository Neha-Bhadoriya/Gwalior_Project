<h5>SheetaRam Mandir in Achleswar Temple</h5>

<p class="text-justify">History-
<br>
                There is a magnificent temple in Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh where devotion is a communion. Which is considered to be one of the wonderful pilgrimage centres all over Gwalior or rather all over Madhya Pradesh. This temple is Adidev, Brahmannayak, Deva of Devon, Aghori Nath Shri bholenath Baba's "Achleswar Mandir".

 This temple has a great incredible story of Shivling
The lingam is said to have come out of the Earth itself, a small portion of the shivling was out of the ground..

On seeing him, the Maharaja of Gwalior, Jivajirao Scindia, had resorted to jamers and many other elephants to flush him out, (while he did not know that he was the shivling), but shivling did not move. This shivling automatically turned out.</p>

<img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-J7MddQT0890/XOZxzkrU30I/AAAAAAAAAoM/X_BQ_GXdLPIn2SmyFo8OR7a3IcUVn3iHQCLcBGAs/s640/SAVE_20190523_150539.jpeg" style="width: 100%">


<p class="text-justify">On the same night, Maharaj Jivajirao Scindia dreams of Mahadev himself to construct a temple at a place where you were going to remove the stone yesterday, from the grots and the jumpers.
 Maharaj then understood him as a good sign and built the temple.
The time of existence of this shivling is around 150 years ago from today.
People say that the idea that comes here must be achieve as want
. On the auspicious occasion-here on various sacred festivals such as Sharad Purnima, Ram Navami, and in particular, on the auspicious Maha-Parv of Mahashivratri, crowds of millions of devotees gather as a crowd of 24 hours, i.e..

There is a daily public feast, a child's indulgence at 9pm, and a night of milk.
 Ram Darbar- The trust has constructed the temple affiliated to the Achleswar Temple, which we know as Ram Darbar. Which is built next to the Acheswar temple.
Inside this temple, the magnificent statue of Ganesh Bhagwan, Hanuman Ji, devi Maa, Krishna-Radha and Sita-ram-Laxman at the main gate is established respectively.
On going inside the temple, or on moving from the temple side (two paths), the Divine Idol of Lord Bholenath, and the statue of a great grand Nataraj behind them, is in the wall, which is a giant, reflecting grandeur.
Trust-Temple Trust, Acheswar Mahadev is known as public trust, which is purely private.
Its establishment Was in 2007 / 08.
Its president is selected through elections or voting, every time.
Around 3 to 4 lakh rupees is for a trust temple every month.
A marriage conference is also held every year for 22 consecutive years through the trust, in which hundreds of couples are married. In the traditional marriage, they are given free matrimonial materials, which include ornaments, utensils, rings, etc.
The chief priest here is Pandit Shri Chhotelal Shukla Ji, whose age is about 70 years (in 2019). Apart from these, there are about 13 priests in the temple.

<p class="text-justify">History-
<br>
                There is a magnificent temple in Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh where devotion is a communion. Which is considered to be one of the wonderful pilgrimage centres all over Gwalior or rather all over Madhya Pradesh. This temple is Adidev, Brahmannayak, Deva of Devon, Aghori Nath Shri bholenath Baba's "Achleswar Mandir".

 This temple has a great incredible story of Shivling
The lingam is said to have come out of the Earth itself, a small portion of the shivling was out of the ground..

On seeing him, the Maharaja of Gwalior, Jivajirao Scindia, had resorted to jamers and many other elephants to flush him out, (while he did not know that he was the shivling), but shivling did not move. This shivling automatically turned out.</p>

<p class="text-justify">On the same night, Maharaj Jivajirao Scindia dreams of Mahadev himself to construct a temple at a place where you were going to remove the stone yesterday, from the grots and the jumpers.
 Maharaj then understood him as a good sign and built the temple.
The time of existence of this shivling is around 150 years ago from today.
People say that the idea that comes here must be achieve as want
. On the auspicious occasion-here on various sacred festivals such as Sharad Purnima, Ram Navami, and in particular, on the auspicious Maha-Parv of Mahashivratri, crowds of millions of devotees gather as a crowd of 24 hours, i.e..

There is a daily public feast, a child's indulgence at 9pm, and a night of milk.
 Ram Darbar- The trust has constructed the temple affiliated to the Achleswar Temple, which we know as Ram Darbar. Which is built next to the Acheswar temple.
Inside this temple, the magnificent statue of Ganesh Bhagwan, Hanuman Ji, devi Maa, Krishna-Radha and Sita-ram-Laxman at the main gate is established respectively.
On going inside the temple, or on moving from the temple side (two paths), the Divine Idol of Lord Bholenath, and the statue of a great grand Nataraj behind them, is in the wall, which is a giant, reflecting grandeur.
Trust-Temple Trust, Acheswar Mahadev is known as public trust, which is purely private.
Its establishment Was in 2007 / 08.
Its president is selected through elections or voting, every time.
Around 3 to 4 lakh rupees is for a trust temple every month.
A marriage conference is also held every year for 22 consecutive years through the trust, in which hundreds of couples are married. In the traditional marriage, they are given free matrimonial materials, which include ornaments, utensils, rings, etc.
The chief priest here is Pandit Shri Chhotelal Shukla Ji, whose age is about 70 years (in 2019). Apart from these, there are about 13 priests in the temple.

<p class="text-justify">History-
<br>
                There is a magnificent temple in Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh where devotion is a communion. Which is considered to be one of the wonderful pilgrimage centres all over Gwalior or rather all over Madhya Pradesh. This temple is Adidev, Brahmannayak, Deva of Devon, Aghori Nath Shri bholenath Baba's "Achleswar Mandir".

 This temple has a great incredible story of Shivling
The lingam is said to have come out of the Earth itself, a small portion of the shivling was out of the ground..

On seeing him, the Maharaja of Gwalior, Jivajirao Scindia, had resorted to jamers and many other elephants to flush him out, (while he did not know that he was the shivling), but shivling did not move. This shivling automatically turned out.</p>

<p class="text-justify">On the same night, Maharaj Jivajirao Scindia dreams of Mahadev himself to construct a temple at a place where you were going to remove the stone yesterday, from the grots and the jumpers.
 Maharaj then understood him as a good sign and built the temple.
The time of existence of this shivling is around 150 years ago from today.
People say that the idea that comes here must be achieve as want
. On the auspicious occasion-here on various sacred festivals such as Sharad Purnima, Ram Navami, and in particular, on the auspicious Maha-Parv of Mahashivratri, crowds of millions of devotees gather as a crowd of 24 hours, i.e..

There is a daily public feast, a child's indulgence at 9pm, and a night of milk.
 Ram Darbar- The trust has constructed the temple affiliated to the Achleswar Temple, which we know as Ram Darbar. Which is built next to the Acheswar temple.
Inside this temple, the magnificent statue of Ganesh Bhagwan, Hanuman Ji, devi Maa, Krishna-Radha and Sita-ram-Laxman at the main gate is established respectively.
On going inside the temple, or on moving from the temple side (two paths), the Divine Idol of Lord Bholenath, and the statue of a great grand Nataraj behind them, is in the wall, which is a giant, reflecting grandeur.
Trust-Temple Trust, Acheswar Mahadev is known as public trust, which is purely private.
Its establishment Was in 2007 / 08.
Its president is selected through elections or voting, every time.
Around 3 to 4 lakh rupees is for a trust temple every month.
A marriage conference is also held every year for 22 consecutive years through the trust, in which hundreds of couples are married. In the traditional marriage, they are given free matrimonial materials, which include ornaments, utensils, rings, etc.
The chief priest here is Pandit Shri Chhotelal Shukla Ji, whose age is about 70 years (in 2019). Apart from these, there are about 13 priests in the temple.

Which is considered to be one of the wonderful pilgrimage centres all over Gwalior or rather all over Madhya Pradesh. This temple is Adidev, Brahmannayak, Deva of Devon, Aghori Nath Shri bholenath Baba's "Achleswar Mandir".

 This temple has a great incredible story of Shivling
The lingam is said to have come out of the Earth itself, a small portion of the shivling was out of the ground..

On seeing him, the Maharaja of Gwalior, Jivajirao Scindia, had resorted to jamers and many other elephants to flush him out, (while he did not know that he was the shivling), but shivling did not move. This shivling automatically turned out.</p>

<p class="text-justify">On the same night, Maharaj Jivajirao Scindia dreams of Mahadev himself to construct a temple at a place where you were going to remove the stone yesterday, from the grots and the jumpers.
 Maharaj then understood him as a good sign and built the temple.
The time of existence of this shivling is around 150 years ago from today.
People say that the idea that comes here must be achieve as want
. On the auspicious occasion-here on various sacred festivals such as Sharad Purnima, Ram Navami, and in particular, on the auspicious Maha-Parv of Mahashivratri, crowds of millions of devotees gather as a crowd of 24 hours, i.e..

There is a daily public feast, a child's indulgence at 9pm, and a night of milk.
 Ram Darbar- The trust has constructed the temple affiliated to the Achleswar Temple, which we know as Ram Darbar. Which is built next to the Acheswar temple.
Inside this temple, the magnificent statue of Ganesh Bhagwan, Hanuman Ji, devi Maa, Krishna-Radha and Sita-ram-Laxman at the main gate is established respectively.
On going inside the temple, or on moving from the temple side (two paths), the Divine Idol of Lord Bholenath, and the statue of a great grand Nataraj behind them, is in the wall, which is a giant, reflecting grandeur.
Trust-Temple Trust, Acheswar Mahadev is known as public trust, which is purely private.
Its establishment Was in 2007 / 08.
Its president is selected through elections or voting, every time.
Around 3 to 4 lakh rupees is for a trust temple every month.
A marriage conference is also held every year for 22 consecutive years through the trust, in which hundreds of couples are married. In the traditional marriage, they are given free matrimonial materials, which include ornaments, utensils, rings, etc.
The chief priest here is Pandit Shri Chhotelal Shukla Ji, whose age is about 70 years (in 2019). Apart from these, there are about 13 priests in the temple.
